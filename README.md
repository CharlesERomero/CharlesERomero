# Hi, I'm Charles!

I'm an astrophysics researcher with a strong mathematical background and over 15 years of experience building, optimizing, and
updating data processing and analysis software within collaboration environments primarily in Python and IDL languages. I'm always looking to improve myself as well as the tools with which I work. 

## Projects

Below I list a repository that is intended for distribution (as a package; see also [ReadTheDocs](https://m2-tj.readthedocs.io) ). I developed this repository given the need for astronomers looking to use MUSTANG-2 (i.e. propose for observing time with MUSTANG-2 on the Green Bank Telescope) to be able to simulate observations without access to proprietary tools. 

- ðŸ”­: [**M2_ProposalTools**](https://github.com/CharlesERomero/M2_TJ): Generates many required and useful products for the technical justification section of MUSTANG-2 observing proposals.

Other projects listed here relate to simpler simulations of observations and/or methods of fitting galaxy cluster models to data. Without a clear demand for use by others, these have not been released as Python packages.
